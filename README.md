# Straw

Straw is a framework aiming to ease development of cloud based business automation applications, i.e applications that use BPMS and DMS in their core.

Straw tries to adopt best existing open-source frameworks in that area, e.g Kogito for implementing business automations and Vue.js for providing advanced, polished ui.
